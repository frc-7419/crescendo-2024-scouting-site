# 🚀 7419 Scouting App 📊

A cutting-edge scouting app designed for the FRC 2024 Crescendo season. 🤖

## Features 🌟

- **Cloud-based**: ☁️ Access your data from anywhere, anytime.
- **Real-time data**: 📈 Get updates on match statistics and team performance.
- **Intuitive Interface**: 🎨 Easy-to-use design for seamless scouting experience.
- **Blue Alliance Integration**: 🤝 Seamlessly integrate data from Blue Alliance for match and scouting schedules as well
  as team information.
- **Scouting Schedule**: 🗓️ Plan your scouting schedule efficiently with a built-in schedule feature.
- **Data Analysis**: 🔍 Dive deep into match data to uncover insights and strategies.
- **Data Visualization**: 📊 Visualize match trends and team performance through dynamic graphs and charts.

## To Do 📝

- Implement alliance selection and match strategy features. 🛡️
- Data across all events and event selection. 📈
- Add offline support for data collection in areas with limited connectivity. 📴
- Develop custom scouting report templates for different scouting strategies. 📋
- Customize scouting forms, data visualization, analysis tools for specific team needs. 🛠️

Currently customizibility is very limited and many things are hard coded. This is an area of improvement we are working on so basically right now it's a proof of concept for a scouting app that can be used by many teams.
